12.  ADC bargph
 Write driver for ADC0 in LPC 1857 MCU. Display digital value on GLCD in bar 
graph such that length is directly proportional to ADC value.   Write driver functions 
for ADC initialization, ADC start of conversion, reading digital value output. 
Develop main function using APIs of ADC driver to test the functionality.
